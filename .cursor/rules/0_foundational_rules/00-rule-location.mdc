description: Cursor Rules Location Rule
globs: *.mdc
alwaysApply: true

## Description
This rule ensures that all new MDC (Model-Driven Code) rules are created in the `.cursor/rules` directory, maintaining a consistent and organized structure for rule management within this project.

## Rule
When creating new MDC rules:
1. All new MDC rules MUST be created in the `.cursor/rules` directory.
2. Each rule MUST be in a separate file.
3. Rule files MUST use the `.mdc` extension.
4. Rule files MUST follow the naming convention: `[category]-[topic].mdc` (e.g., `typescript-strict-types.mdc`, `react-component-patterns.mdc`).
5. Rule files MUST contain proper markdown formatting and rule structure.

## Implementation
- Cursor IDE should be instructed to place new rules here.
- Reject any attempt to create `.mdc` files outside `.cursor/rules/`.

## Benefits
- Centralized rule management.
- Consistent project structure.
- Easier discovery and version control of rules.

## Examples
✅ Correct Location:
```
PROJECT_ROOT/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       ├── 00-rule-location.mdc
│       ├── 10-typescript-strict.mdc
│       └── ...
└── ...
```

❌ Incorrect Location:
```
PROJECT_ROOT/
├── rules/my-rule.mdc
├── my-rule.mdc
```
