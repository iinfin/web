<title>MDC Rule File Location and Naming</title>

<description>
Ensures all Model-Driven Code (MDC) rules are consistently created and named within the designated `.cursor/rules` directory, promoting organization and maintainability.
</description>

<context>
A standardized location and naming convention for MDC rules is crucial for easy discovery, management, version control, and automated processing within the project.
</context>

<guidelines>
1.  **Directory**: All new MDC rule files MUST be created exclusively within the `.cursor/rules` directory at the project root.
2.  **File Separation**: Each distinct rule MUST reside in its own separate file.
3.  **Extension**: All rule files MUST use the `.mdc` file extension.
4.  **Naming Convention**: Rule files MUST follow the format `[category]/[numeric_prefix]-[topic].mdc`.
    *   `[category]`: A directory representing the rule's category (e.g., `0_foundational_rules`, `1_technical_stack_rules`).
    *   `[numeric_prefix]`: A two-digit number for ordering within the category (e.g., `00`, `10`, `21`).
    *   `[topic]`: A short, descriptive kebab-case name for the rule's subject (e.g., `rule-location`, `typescript-strict`).
    *   Example: `1_technical_stack_rules/10-typescript-strict.mdc`
5.  **Content**: Rule files MUST contain well-structured Markdown content, adhering to the standard rule format (like this one).
</guidelines>

<implementation>
-   **Automation**: The Cursor IDE should be configured or instructed to automatically place new rules in `.cursor/rules/[category]/`.
-   **Validation**: Any attempt (manual or automated) to create `.mdc` files outside the designated `.cursor/rules` directory structure should be prevented or flagged as an error.
</implementation>
